DESCRIPTION: This program is a RPN Calculator that performs many diffrent operations on binary strings.
HONOR CODE: On my honor, I have neither given nor received help on this test/assignment. Evan Phillips.
HOWTO: Put all of the submitted files into one folder and hit the compile button if necessary and then press the run button.
INPUT FILE: NA
OUTPUT FILE: NA
BIBLIOGRAPHY: I looked up what a circular shift was on baeldung.com.
RESOURCES: Max helped me with the right circular shift.
TUTORS: NA
COMMENTS: NA
REFLECTION: This assignment took me around three hours and a half to complete. One problem I encountered was figuring out how to do the shifts given two operands. I came up with the solution to use the value of the second operand as how many times the shift should occur.
