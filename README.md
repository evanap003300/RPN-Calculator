# Reverse Polish Notation (RPN) Calculator

A simple Java-based calculator that evaluates expressions written in **Reverse Polish Notation (RPN)** using binary operators. This project demonstrates the use of fundamental data structures (like stacks) and object-oriented programming principles.

## Overview

This project simulates the evaluation of arithmetic expressions using Reverse Polish Notation â€” a mathematical notation in which operators follow their operands. It avoids the need for parentheses and operator precedence rules.

The calculator:
- Supports binary arithmetic operations.
- Demonstrates stack-based expression parsing.
- Includes test coverage via `RPNNibbleTester.java`.

| File Name            | Description                                |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| `Calculator.java`     | Main class that performs RPN calculations. |
| `NibbleMath.java`     | Handles nibble (4-bit) arithmetic operations. |
| `Operand.java`        | Represents numerical operands in expressions. |
| `RPNNibbleTester.java`| Contains test cases for the calculator.    |
| `Stack.java`          | Stack data structure implementation.       |

## How to Compile and Run

1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.

2. Compile all `.java` files using:
   ```bash
   javac *.java
   ```

3. Once compiled, you can run the tester or the calculator directly:

   Run the test suite:
   ```bash
   java RPNNibbleTester
   ```

   Or run the calculator itself:
   ```bash
   java Calculator
   ```

## Example Usage

For the input expression:
```
3 4 + 2 *
```

The calculator will compute:
```
(3 + 4) * 2 = 14
```

This shows how RPN naturally handles operator precedence using a stack.

## Requirements

* Java JDK 8 or higher.
* Basic knowledge of Java and command-line tools.
* Terminal or IDE to compile and run Java code.
